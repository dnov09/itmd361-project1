    <h3>Hobbies</h3>
    <p>In my free time, I go longboarding. I actually started doing this at the beginning of the Fall 2020 semester and
      it has been one thing that has kept me calm throughout all this craziness.</p>

    <p>After a nice relaxing longboarding session, I come back to my computer sceen and lose money in cryptocurrency
      markets.</p>

    <h4>Anime</h4>
    <p>I am a big anime fan. Currently my favorite anime is <strong>Hunter X Hunter</strong></p>
    <p>I believe that anime is a masterpiece and I hope it is finished before I take my last breath.</p>

    <h4>Music</h4>
    <p>My music consists of alot of rap, some rnb, alternative, indie, synthwave and movie soundtracks(yes they are
      amazing).</p>
    <p>At present, my favorite rapper is Boogie. A crazy talented rapper from Compton whose lyrical genius is
      something to marvel at.</p>

    <p>Another thing I have come to love are movie soundtracks. Hans Zimmer has to be my favorite composer in that
      category. His work on the moviee Interstellar was sublime.</p>
    <p>My favorite movie soundtrack is Mountains by Hans Zimmer on Interstellar. The effects might not be the same
      without watching the movie scene but I believe it is beautiful nonetheless.</p>
    <p>Put your headpones on and enjoy.</p>
